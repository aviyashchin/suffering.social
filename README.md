> **If a tree falls in the forest and doesn't boost GDP, does it matter? Now imagine that tree is your child's mental health.**

A research-based calculator that estimates the economic impact of social media on mental health, using peer-reviewed studies and government data.

🔗 **Live Calculator**: [suffering.social](https://suffering.social)

## 📊 What This Calculator Does

This tool quantifies the hidden economic costs of social media's impact on mental health through three research-backed components:

- **☠️ Mortality Costs**: Deaths attributable to social media × Value of Statistical Life  
- **😞 Disability Costs**: Affected population × disability duration × quality impact × annual QALY value
- **💸 Productivity Costs**: Economic losses from healthcare and workplace impacts

**Current Estimate**: **$2.48 Trillion** total economic impact since 2009
