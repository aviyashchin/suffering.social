> **If a tree falls in the forest and doesn't boost GDP, does it matter? Now imagine that tree is your child's mental health.**

A research-based calculator that estimates the economic impact of social media on mental health, using peer-reviewed studies and government data.

🔗 **Live Calculator**: [suffering.social](https://www.suffering.social)

## 📊 What This Calculator Does

This tool quantifies the hidden economic costs of social media's impact on mental health through three research-backed components:

- **☠️ Mortality Costs**: Deaths attributable to social media × Value of Statistical Life  
- **😞 Disability Costs**: Affected population × disability duration × quality impact × annual QALY value
- **💸 Productivity Costs**: Economic losses from healthcare and workplace impacts

**Current Estimate**: **$2.48 Trillion** total economic impact since 2009

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Just View the Calculator
Simply visit [suffering.social](https://www.suffering.social) - no installation needed!

### Option 2: Run Locally
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aviyashchin/suffering.social.git
cd suffering.social

# Install dependencies (optional)
npm install

# Start local server
npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:3000
```

### Privacy-safe telemetry

Telemetry fails closed and is disabled by default. Copy `.env.example` to a local `.env` only when validating a provider in preview, and enable one provider at a time. The shared runtime emits only canonical `page_view` and allowlisted `cta_clicked` events. It excludes calculator inputs, query strings, page text, session replay, and person-level identities.

```bash
npm run verify:fast
```

This runs the Jest contracts, production build, and built-output privacy/SEO checks. Production rollout and rollback steps live in `docs/GROWTH_OPERATIONS.md`.

### Option 3: Fork and Customize
1. Click the **Fork** button on GitHub
2. Clone your fork
3. Modify parameters, add new research, or change the methodology
4. Deploy your version (works on Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)
